title: 2023 competition
---

For our 2023 competition, 12 teams (50 researchers) competed to see who can best use measures of physiology to model moment-to-moment ratings of two elementary components of emotional experience: feelings of valence and arousals.

Challenge details will be (a) reviewed at 2023 Affective Computing + Intelligence Interaction Conference workshop in September, and (b) described in a forthcoming manuscript co-authored by the teams and the competition organizers.

        <h3>Competitor Selection</h3>
        Teams (or individuals) were eligible to participate in the competition if they (1) had significant experience in machine learning, and (2) were affiliated with an academic institution. We sought to invite up to 15 teams to participate in the initiative.

        <h3>Database Distribution</h3>
         Teams used a small dataset to examine how well moment-to-moment, continuous ratings of valence and arousal could be modeled using 8 physiological features (e.g., ECG, EDA, RSP, and EMG).

        <h3>Model Testing and Open Science</h3>
        To examine how well models perform when exposed to different people and emotion contexts, teams validated their models (1) across time, (2) across subjects, (3) across emotion categories, and (4) across stimuli.

        <h3>Results Dissemination</h3>
        Teams were invited to submit short papers describing their approach to an accepted workshop at the 2023 ACII Conference. They are now working on a collaborative paper describes the competition results, limitations, and future directions.
