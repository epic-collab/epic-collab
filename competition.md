For our pilot, researchers will compete to see who can best use measures of physiology to model moment-to-moment ratings of two elementary components of emotional experience: feelings of valence and arousals. Afterwards, these same researchers will collaborate on a paper that describes the competition results and future directions for improving the accuracy and generalizability of emotion recognition research. <br><br>In addition to co-authorship, competitors will receive a small stipend. To express interest in joining the competition, please fill out this <a href = "https://forms.gle/gUtxGkgHbTkyhcaQ9">form</a>.

        <h3>Competitor Selection</h3>
        Researchers can apply to participate in the competition if they (1) have significant experience in machine learning, and (2) are  affiliated with an academic institution. <br><br>12 competitors will be chosen to participate in the initiative and will afterwards receive a small stipend.

        <h3>Database Distribution</h3>
        Competitors will be given 4 emotion modeling challenges. For each challenge, they will be asked to model moment-to-moment self-report ratings of valence and arousal using 8 moment-to-moment physiology recordings (e.g., electrocardiography, galvanic skin response, temperature).

        <h3>Model Testing and Open Science</h3>
        Model testing will involve a combination of k-fold and hold-out cross-validation. The competitors with the best models fits will receive a small monetary prize.<br><br>To facilitate code checking and sharing, all code will be made openly-available.

        <h3>Results Dissemination</h3>
        Competitors will be invited to submit papers describing their approach to a workshop at the <a href = "https://acii-conf.net/">2023 Affective Computing + Intelligence Interaction Conference</a>. Afterwards, they will be invited to co-author a manuscript that describes the competition results, limitations, and future directions.
