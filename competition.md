title: 2023 competition
---

For our 2023 competition, teams will compete to see who can best use measures of physiology to model moment-to-moment ratings of two elementary components of emotional experience: feelings of valence and arousals. Afterwards, these teams researchers will collaborate on a paper that describes the competition results and future directions for improving the accuracy and generalizability of emotion recognition research. <br><br>Pending budgetary approval, teams will be eligible to receive (a) $300 USD for participation, and (b) one of three $200 USD performance-based award. To express interest in joining the competition, please fill out this <a href = "https://forms.gle/gUtxGkgHbTkyhcaQ9">form</a>.

        <h3>Competitor Selection</h3>
        Teams can apply to participate in the competition if they (1) have significant experience in machine learning, and (2) are  affiliated with an academic institution. Up to 15 teams will be chosen to participate in the initiative.

        <h3>Database Distribution</h3>
         Teams will use a small dataset to examine how well moment-to-moment, continuous ratings of valence and arousal can be modeled using 8 physiological features (e.g., ECG, EDA, RSP, and EMG).

        <h3>Model Testing and Open Science</h3>
        To examine how well models perform when exposed to different people and emotion contexts, teams will cross-validate their models (1) across time, (2) across subjects, (3) across emotion categories, and (4) across stimuli.<br><br>To facilitate code checking and sharing, all code will be made openly-available.

        <h3>Results Dissemination</h3>
        Teams will be invited to submit papers describing their approach to an accepted workshop at the <a href = "https://acii-conf.net/">2023 Affective Computing + Intelligence Interaction Conference</a>. Afterwards, they will be invited to co-author a manuscript that describes the competition results, limitations, and future directions.

## Team Selection Criteria
The competition organizers will review applications and rate the teams on the three following categories: 

1. Expertise in affective science domain (0 - novice, 1 - some documented experience, 2 - experienced, 3 - experts)

2. Experience participating in shared task challenges (0 - none, 1 - participated once or twice, 2 - participated many times, 3 - best solution awards)

3. Planned approach to the task (0 - no idea, 1 - simple ML, 2 - advanced models planned, 3 - multimodal approach with reasonable architecture/models)

These ratings will be used to identify up to 15 teams to invite to the challenge.
